### <p align="center"> Versatile Data Scientist with experiences in various industries and ML projects
My strength lies in strong curiosity, autonomy, and willingness to learn. What excites me the most is when I get to tackle challenges and difficult problems - because I know that's when I get to learn new techniques and scientific concept. I adore diversity in the same reason, I want to learn from different views from different reference poins.</p>
